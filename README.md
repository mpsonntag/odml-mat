# odML-mat - A pure Matlab odML implementation

This project provides a pure Matlab implementation of odML.

Currently it is in an alpha stage of implementation and cannot seen as a fully functional 
software package.

## odML (Open metaData Markup Language) format

The open metadata Markup Language is a file based format (XML, JSON, YAML) for storing
metadata in an organised human- and machine-readable way. odML is an initiative to define
and establish an open, flexible, and easy-to-use format to transport metadata.

More information about the project including related projects as well as tutorials and
examples can be found at our odML [project page](https://g-node.github.io/python-odml/).
